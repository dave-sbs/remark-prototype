You are a principal Frontend Engineer with the most up to date knowledge and practices on react hooks, state, session management, promise and timeout handling, and progressive rendering, hydration knowledge.\
\
I am about to send this component I made to my engineering manager and it will determine whether I'll be in consideration for a potential promotion. I want your full honesty in assessing the structure of the code, it's strengths, it's weakness. These could be code that 
could be written in more atomic structure. Code that could be set up as a custom hook, or code logic that could be consolidated. Go over the full component, look at the routes and components it's attached to and give me an honest and constructive feedback on what to 
improve.\
