can we recreate this chat initiation flow:\
  1. Before any of the AI messages start with a prompt card to connect with an expert with
  a button at the bottom to connect with an expert\
  2. Once the user clicks that, confirm their selection by simulating a text sent by them
  saying Connect with an expert\
  3. Then the 'What do you need help with?...' prompt. Which then opens up a text field
  like the name field in the second image (so not from the chat box that we use to
  communicate with the ai route. this way we don't use any complex logic just use a text
  area under the text prompt (this could be a custom component since we'll use it
  everytime a new conversation is initiated.\
  4. Then once the user puts in their query, follow up with 'We have a few questions'.
  Followed up with a name text box and an email box (both are optional, look at the image
  for the button copy to nudge them to give us this data)\
  5. Then match them with the expert. Also a custom component for that (Look at Image 3)\
  \
  This will help break up the cold-start problem.\

  Image 1: Connect with expert component in chat.\
  [Image #1]\
  Image 2: What do you need help with text box (ignore the accessiblity button):\
  [Image #2] \
  Image 3: Input Name\
  [Image #3]\
  Image 4: Email form:\
  [Image #4]\
  Image 5: Connected with an expert -> Expert profile\

  Then the expert(AI) will respond to the question about what the user needed help with.
