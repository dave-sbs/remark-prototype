# Pricing Data JSON Files - Notes and Uncertainties

## Files Created
1. `product_variants.json` - Base pricing by product size/model variants
2. `product_addons.json` - Add-on pricing for customization options
3. `product_configurations.json` - Pre-configured bundles with total pricing

## Missing/Uncertain Data

### Product Variants (`product_variants.json`)
- **Lino Chair base price**: PRICES.md only states "under $1,000, commonly $700-$900". Used **$800** as midpoint estimate.
- **Aeron Size A pricing**: PRICES.md doesn't specify if Size A has different base pricing than Size B. Assumed same base price of **$1,275.99**.
- **Aeron Size C pricing**: PRICES.md shows "+$1,956" but unclear if this is additive or total MSRP. Calculated as **$3,231.99** (base + upgrade).

### Product Add-ons (`product_addons.json`)
**Missing specific pricing for:**
- **Aeron Chair - Fully Adjustable Arms**: PRICES.md says "contact dealer" - set to `null`
- **Lino Chair - Arm options** (Fixed, Height-Adjustable, Fully Adjustable): PRICES.md mentions "up to $80-$100 add-on" but no exact prices - set to `null`
- **Lino Chair - Polished Aluminum Base**: PRICES.md mentions "moderate upcharge" but no specific price - set to `null`
- **Cosm Chair - MicrobeCare**: PRICES.md shows range "$70-$125", used midpoint **$97.50**

**Incompatible add-ons**: The schema includes `incompatible_addons` field (e.g., can't have both Fixed Arms and Height-Adjustable Arms simultaneously), but PRICES.md doesn't specify these relationships. All set to empty arrays `[]`.

**Requires variant type**: The `requires_variant_type` field could link add-ons to specific variants (e.g., certain arm pads only for specific models), but this information isn't in PRICES.md. All set to `null`.

### Product Configurations (`product_configurations.json`)
- **Limited configurations**: Only created 11 sample configurations based on common/logical combinations. Real-world data would have many more.
- **Lino "Ergonomic Mid-Tier" total price**: Cannot calculate without arm pricing - set to `null`
- **Popularity ranks**: Assigned based on assumptions (e.g., base models ranked #1). Real data would come from sales analytics.
- **Addon references**: Used `addon_names` array with string names for clarity, but schema expects `addon_ids` UUID array - would need to be resolved during import with proper foreign key lookups.

### Tables Not Created (Insufficient Data)

#### `price_insights` Table
**Required fields not in source data:**
- `comparison_type`: Needs structured comparison categories
- `key_message`: Requires sales/marketing messaging data
- `supporting_data`: JSONB field needs structured comparison metrics
- `effectiveness_score`: Needs conversion/engagement analytics

**What would be needed:** Sales team talking points, A/B test results, customer feedback on pricing messaging.

#### `price_behavior_patterns` Table
**Required fields not in source data:**
- `user_segment`: Needs customer segmentation data (e.g., "enterprise IT manager", "home office professional")
- `sensitivity_indicators`: Behavioral signals from conversations (e.g., "mentions budget first", "asks about financing")
- `effective_responses`: Learned chatbot responses that increased conversion
- `conversion_rate`: Analytics data from past conversations
- `sample_size`: Number of conversations analyzed

**What would be needed:** Historical chat logs, CRM data, user personas, conversion analytics, A/B testing of responses.

## Data Quality Notes

### Strengths
- ✅ All variant base prices extracted successfully
- ✅ Most add-on prices clearly specified in PRICES.md
- ✅ Good coverage of customization options across all products

### Limitations
- ⚠️ No data on option compatibility/conflicts
- ⚠️ No behavioral or conversational learning data
- ⚠️ Limited information on variant requirements for specific add-ons
- ⚠️ Popularity rankings are assumptions, not real sales data
- ⚠️ Configuration examples are manually created, not from actual customer preferences

## Recommendations

1. **For missing add-on prices**: Contact Herman Miller sales team or scrape official configurator
2. **For incompatible_addons**: Create compatibility matrix from product specification documents
3. **For price_insights & price_behavior_patterns**: Implement conversation logging and analytics pipeline to learn from real customer interactions
4. **For embeddings**: All embedding fields set to `null` - would need to generate via OpenAI API after import
5. **For configurations**: Analyze actual order data to identify most popular configurations and accurate total pricing
