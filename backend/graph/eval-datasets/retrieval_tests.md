Here are 8 different customer scenarios at the Herman Miller shop:

## Scenario 1: The Remote Worker with Back Pain
**Customer Profile:** Sarah, 32, marketing manager who switched to full-time remote work
**Situation:** "Hi, I've been working from home for two years now and I'm really struggling with lower back pain. I've been using a cheap office chair and my physical therapist said I need to invest in something better. I sit for about 8-10 hours a day. What would you recommend? I've heard the Aeron is good, but I'm honestly not sure what the difference is between all these chairs."

## Scenario 2: The Budget-Conscious Startup Founder
**Customer Profile:** Marcus, 28, tech startup founder furnishing first office
**Situation:** "So I need to outfit an office for about 8 people. We're a young company, so budget matters, but I also want my team to be comfortable since we're putting in long hours. What's the most cost-effective option here? And do you offer any bulk discounts? I'm looking at the Lino because it seems less expensive, but will it hold up with daily use?"

## Scenario 3: The Aesthetic-Focused Creative
**Customer Profile:** Jessica, 41, interior designer working on home office
**Situation:** "I'm redesigning my home office and it's a very modern, minimalist space—lots of white, natural wood, and clean lines. I need something that performs well but also looks incredible. The Eames chair is gorgeous, but is it actually comfortable for working? I'm on video calls constantly and the space needs to look polished. What's the most visually striking option?"

## Scenario 4: The Tall, Heavy-Set Executive
**Customer Profile:** David, 55, CFO, 6'4" and 270 lbs
**Situation:** "I'm replacing my office chair after 10 years. I'm a bigger guy—six-four, about 270 pounds—and I need something that's going to support me properly. My last chair started sagging after a few years. Can these chairs handle my size? And I run hot, so breathability is important. Which one is the most durable for someone my size?"

## Scenario 5: The Indecisive First-Time Buyer
**Customer Profile:** Amy, 26, graphic designer, first major furniture purchase
**Situation:** "Okay, so I've watched like a million YouTube reviews and I still can't decide. Everyone says the Aeron is the gold standard, but then some people love the Cosm, and the Lino seems newer? I've never spent this much on a chair before—can I try them all? What's the actual difference? And like, is the Aeron worth the extra money, or is that just hype?"

## Scenario 6: The Ergonomics-Obsessed Engineer
**Customer Profile:** Robert, 44, software engineer with specific posture needs
**Situation:** "I need something with highly adjustable lumbar support—I have a herniated disc at L4-L5. I also need adjustable arm height and depth, seat depth adjustment, and ideally a forward tilt mechanism for when I'm typing. I've done my research and I know the Aeron has PostureFit, but how does that compare to the lumbar system on the Cosm? Can you walk me through the specific ergonomic adjustments on each model?"

## Scenario 7: The Corporate Procurement Manager
**Customer Profile:** Linda, 51, facilities manager for law firm
**Situation:** "I'm furnishing a new office floor—about 40 workstations. Half are for associates who are in their twenties and thirties, half are for partners who are older and have different needs. Some people want adjustability, others just want to sit down and not think about it. Would it make sense to get different chairs for different people, or should I standardize? And what's your lead time on a large order like this?"

## Scenario 8: The Skeptical Partner
**Customer Profile:** Tom, 38, came with partner who wants to buy a chair
**Situation:** "Look, my wife really wants one of these chairs. I'm just here because she dragged me along. But seriously—$1,500 for a chair? What am I missing? I bought a chair on Amazon for $200 and it's fine. Can you actually explain to me why these are worth it? Like, what physically makes this worth seven times more than a regular office chair? I'm not trying to be difficult, I just genuinely don't understand."

## Scenario 9: Weird Desk Setup
**Customer Profile:** Dave, 21, has a really weird table with sort of a kitchen island height
**Situation:** "I have this weird table setup at my house. The table's height is pretty high, it's like a kitchen bar island sort of height. And I was wondering do you guys have chairs that would sort of have either a stool type of configuration or just high enough so that I can sit and work from that bar table?"
